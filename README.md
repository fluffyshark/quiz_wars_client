**Description**
Web app built with React Typescript to increase student engagement in lessons with tematic math/quiz competitions. Up to four groups of students can compete for supremacy of the map. They just need one more point in a region than the other teams to claim it.  Future updates includes the founding of town, building of fortresses, and the casting of spells. All for engaging the students and keep their minds of that they are actually learning.

The app is split between a React Typescript client and an Express server. Both parts are currently hosted
on Render. The parts communicate via socket.io. Redux is used as a global store in the client part.
